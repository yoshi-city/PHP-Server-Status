# PHP-Server-Status
Adds a server status to your website, as featured on https://yoshi.city/servers.php

Saves queries to a cache file to avoid pinging servers too often.

You can operate runstatistics.php as a cronjob to record server availabilty at set intervals and use showstats.php to display that data in a nice format. It is similar to the GitHub status page, but a lot simpler.

# Code example

See example.php for full code examples and required parameters.

If you have any questions I would be happy to help.
